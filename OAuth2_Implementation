Deliverables:
--A page that has a link a user clicks to visit the Google OAuth 2.0 endpoint
--A page that handles the user getting redirect back to your website from Google's endpoint and handles exchanging of the access code for a token
--A page (which could use the same handler as the page they were redirected to, which uses that token to access and display the following info
	-- Users first name
	-- Users last name
	-- URL to access their Google Plus Account
	-- Print out value of the state variable that was used to secure the original redirect

--Only scope allowed to request is email
	--additional permissions beyond email and assignment will not be graded

--implement a randomly generated state variable and display it along with the users name
